#backend

- I used php laravel framework to make the assignment.
- To install it at your PC you need to install php and composer.

I use laravel for all my projects because of the following:

- It makes it easier to work with complexity.
- Write clean and reusable Code which help to develop project smoothly.
- It forces the team to implement code in a way that promotes consistent coding, fewer bugs, and more flexible applications.
- It makes Testing and Debugging of code easier.

#frontend
For the frontend, I used bower for JS packaging to download the right versions for all pluging
I used css bootstrap as a css framework because of:
- Speed of Development.
- Great grid system.
- Base styling for most HTML elements.
